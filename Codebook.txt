==================================================================

Please see the OriginalCodebook.txt to read about the source data from which this subset is derived.

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 66-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables of the means and standard deviation only.
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'Codebook.txt' (this file)

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector from the original project.

- 'FeaturesUsed.txt': List of the features used in this subset.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'all/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'all/y_train.txt': Training labels.


The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'all/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
